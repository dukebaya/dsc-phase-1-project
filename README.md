 ## Conclusions
 
 This analysis aids in identifying 2 conclusions that would help in setting up the movie studio.

2. Types of movies to create. We have identified that the most popular movies are also the most profitable. We have concluded that the current movies that would increase the brand visibilty and also likey to maximise profits are the movies that incorporate different genres. These Genres are Action and adventure.
